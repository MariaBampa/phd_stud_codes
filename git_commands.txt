Three stages: Working directory, Staging Area, .git directory (Repository). To add files to the staging area:
git add -A		Add all files to staging area
git add .gitignore	Add specific file to staging area

git reset .gitignore Revert specific file from staging area
git reset		Revert all

git commit -m “MESSAGE”	Commit with a specific message

git log		Shows the commit log


2) Create a remote project in Unity
git remote add origin “https://github.com/luiseduve/$repo_name.git”

Clone remote project that you want to start developing in.
git clone <url> <where_to_clone>
git clone ../remote_repo .	Clone in the current directory

View information about remote repository
git remote -v	Information of the repository 
git branch -a	Branches in the repo locally and remotely

When making changes, it is necessary to make pull and then push, to get up-to-date repo
git pull origin <branch>
git push origin <branch>

Common workflow is to create branches instead of working on the MASTER branch
git branch <branchname>		Create branch
git branch				List existing branch
git checkout <branchname>		Work on that branch
